# House_Price_Predictor

# California Housing Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to build and evaluate a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices using the California Housing dataset. The project follows a comprehensive machine learning workflow, including data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and reporting.

## Objectives
- Load and preprocess the California Housing dataset.
- Explore the dataset through EDA to understand patterns and correlations.
- Train a Linear Regression model to predict house prices.
- Evaluate the model's performance using key metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²).
- Save the model for future predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various features such as:
- Median Income
- House Age
- Total Rooms
- Total Bedrooms
- Population
- Ocean Proximity

The target variable for the model is the median house value.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- joblib

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib
